			description = Mortis was discovered and named by astronomer Louis Kerman, and at the time it was the first new moon of Egress discovered in over a decade. Louis Kerman was hailed as one of the best astronomers of the decade for discovering Egress' first known minor moon, and they were more than welcoming of the praise. That is; had it not been for all of the reports mispronouncing his name as "loo-is," when in reality his name was pronounced: "loo-e." In his frustration, Louis Kerman announced that he had changed the pronunciation of his moon from "More-tis" to "Mort-y." This action was incredibly controversial. Throughout the scientific community, you can hear people using both pronunciations to this day..
