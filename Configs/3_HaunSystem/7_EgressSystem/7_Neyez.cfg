			description = Neyez is the most recent moon of Egress to be discovered, (Ro√∂l was hypothesized more recently but has never been properly observed). Despite being brighter than Mortis, its discovery took so long due to its orbit. The Egress System has a very orderly structure, with its 6 other known moons orbiting in one plane with very low eccentricities. Neyez defies all of that order, with an orbit that is approaching polar, crosses the orbits of Vare, Snovus, Kilwae and Fraz, nearly reaches the orbit of Tilda, and on top of all of that, it orbits backwards. This lucky moon has entered a resonance with Snovus, the most massive of Egress' inner moons, which places it in resonance with the other moons as well, meaning it has found a stable keyhole. It is commonly agreed that Neyez must have amazing views..
