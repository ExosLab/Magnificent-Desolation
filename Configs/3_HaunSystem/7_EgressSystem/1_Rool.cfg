			description = Roöl is a moon hypothesized to be responsible for the Ketra Gap in Egress' dark ring system, and if it does exist; Roöl is the smallest object to ever be mathematically predicted. \n \n Egress' rings are charted constantly during stellar occultations. This means that despite the bright main rings being the only easily visible region of the ring system, the darker rings on its flanks have also had their gaps charted. It was astronomer Milfred Kerman who first noted that the Ketra Gap was shifting in size on every occultation, significantly more than other gaps seemed to meander, anomalies passed off as measurement errors. This lead Milfred to publish a paper titled "Potential Clues to a Hidden Egress Moonlet." The paper outlined mass predictions for such a body, and was met with both harsh critique and unending praise alike. If this moon does exist, Milfred in his confidence has already named it; Roöl, a simplification of the phrase "Ruling Moon," for its influence on the rings..
