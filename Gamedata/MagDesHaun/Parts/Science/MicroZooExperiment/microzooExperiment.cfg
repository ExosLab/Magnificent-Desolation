	description = The MicroZoo Containment Unit contains a large variety of different microbes, from simple prokaryotes to relatively complex planktons. It was deemed to be an important experiment to assess the safety of space travel in and around the various enviroments we encounter as we explore space. The biology community is also drooling over getting data on how these microbes react, so we can expect a lot of science to come out of these little things.
